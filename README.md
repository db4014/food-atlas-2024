# Predicting Diabetes with the Food Environment Atlas

<toc>

## Introduction

Diabetes is a major global health issue, affecting millions and incurring significant costs. In the United States alone, the financial burden reached $412.9 billion in 2022 (source: https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/statistics/about-diabetes). Accurate predictions of diabetes incidence are crucial for effective governmental planning and intervention. In response, we have developed predictive regression and classification models to anticipate the diabetes rate in different regions of the United States, and to identify key contributing factors. 

## Dataset

We utilize the Food Environment Atlas (FEA) dataset (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas),  which comprises 284 variables and is compiled by the USDAâ€™s Economic Research Service (ERS). A part of the ERS mission is to foresee trends and issues arising in agriculture, food, and the environment and to conduct objective research with the goal of informing and enhancing public and private decision-making. The dataset contains food environment indicators such as access to food stores, quantity of food stores, and other community characteristics regarding food, health, nutrition, and socioeconomic status for each US county.

The dataset also provides diabetes prevalence data for each county in 2008 and 2013.
